In this task you will be creating three parallel arrays [1 mark total]:

* Course Code - String
* Mark - double
* Teacher - String

[3 marks] You will start by prompting the user for the number of courses that they are taking. Then prompt the user for the data that you will use to fill the arrays. You must use a loop. 

Once you have the data, you will perform the following by using the control structures you have learned (mostly for loops):

1. [2 marks] Display all courses, marks and teachers in an easy to read format. You must display the % (Remember to use an escape character!) eg. 
      ICS3U - Kosh - 90%

2. [2 marks] Find the average of all marks, and display with 1 decimal place.

3. [2 marks] Display all the information (Course, teacher, mark) about the highest mark.

4. [2 marks] Display all the information (Course, teacher, mark) about the lowest mark.

5. [2 marks] Display all course information about courses that you are failing.

6. [2 marks] Display all course information about courses that you have above 90% in.

7. [4 marks] Have the user enter a course code and display all the information about the course.
